Network Speed Indicator
=======================

Displays network speeds on the status bar. Requires a rooted phone with Xposed Module installed.

This is a continuous work from [Dzakus' great work](http://repo.xposed.info/module/pl.com.android.networkspeedindicator). Many thanks to the contributors and translators!

**Translators,** please see notes below.

To install, look for "NetworkSpeedIndicator" in your **Xposed Installer** app. You can also find the APK file in the [Xposed Repository](http://repo.xposed.info/module/tw.fatminmin.xposed.networkspeedindicator).

For support, please open a new issue in the **Issues** section. Or you could fork and fix the issue, then give us a pull request! `:)`

Translating
-----------
Thank you for helping us provide localization of the app. It is very easy to do so on the GitHub website (no need to clone locally) or by using GitHub software (no need to mess with the command line).

When contributing translations (fork, modify and send pull request) please keep the following in mind:
 * Translate the original `strings.xml` in your fork (original source code).
 * Do not translate `strings.xml` or `arrays.xml` extracted from the APK file.
 * Do not translate `values.xml` or `dimens.xml`.
 * Application name (`app_name`) should ideally remain in English, unless your locale specifically requires a translated name.
 * Do not translate or change the value of the "name" attribute.
 * Follow the capitalization and style of the default strings.
 * Only include strings that were translated. Non-translated strings must fall back to defaults in `/res/values/strings.xml`.
 * For string arrays, always include all items in the correct order (regardless of how many items were translated).
 * Place translations in the correct locale folder (for example `/res/values-de/strings.xml`).
 * Remove any obsolete strings that are not present in the default file.
